This “Macro Maker Pro” tool is designed to let you visually record and replay repetitive UI workflows, with the following core capabilities:

Point-and-click recording: Capture mouse clicks and drags anywhere on screen.

Insertable delays: Add or auto-insert pauses between actions to wait for UI elements to load.

Clipboard operations: Record “Copy” (Ctrl+C) and “Paste” (Ctrl+V) steps as part of the sequence.

OCR capture: Define a screen region to OCR; the macro grabs that box, runs Tesseract, finds a 9-digit ID, and copies it to the clipboard.

Action editing & ordering: In the list view you can edit coordinates, insert/delete actions, move them up or down, and set how many times to loop the entire sequence.

One-click playback: Hit “Start Macro” to automatically replay the recorded steps in order, including all clicks, drags, delays, clipboard and OCR operations.

In essence, it turns a series of UI gestures — clicks, drags, waits, copy/paste, even simple OCR — into a reusable, loopable script without writing any code.
